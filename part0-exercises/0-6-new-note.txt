note over browser:
there is an important difference between
SPA and traditional version of the pages:
traditional version would also update the
page the user sees with other notes that 
would have been uploaded during the time 
that user had the page open before
submitting. SPA does not receive an
updated list of notes, therefore is
ignorant of any new notes that could have
been posted in that time. Possible
solution to this is some kind of polling on
a timer.
