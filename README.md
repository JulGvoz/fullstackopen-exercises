## Note regarding part0 exercises

The directory `part0-exercises` was originally called `part0`

After progressing to part1's exercises, I realized that my folder structure was unwieldy, therefore I decided to rename the folder.

## Folder naming structure

Folders named `partX` are for me personally - I will go through the Part, playing around with the code as needed.

Folders named `partX-exercises` will contain additional folders or files, conveniently named `X-Y-exercise-name-here`, where X is the part number, Y is the exercist number, and the rest of the file name describes the name of the exercise. 

For simple enough exercises, no new folder is created, notably in Part 0.

For more sophisticated exercises, individual folders will be created for each exercise.
